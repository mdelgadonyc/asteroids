# Asteroids

A classic arcade game of Asteroids, implemented in Python using Pygame.

## Description

This is a recreation of the classic Asteroids arcade game. The player controls a spaceship that can rotate, move, and shoot. The goal is to destroy asteroids while avoiding collisions. The game features:

- Player-controlled spaceship with movement and shooting mechanics.
- Asteroids of varying sizes that split into smaller asteroids when shot.
- Game over condition when the player collides with an asteroid.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x and Pygame installed.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the `main.py` file using Python: `python main.py`

## Game Mechanics

- **Player:** The player controls a spaceship that can rotate and move in any direction.
- **Asteroids:** Asteroids move across the screen in random directions and speeds.
- **Shooting:** The player can shoot projectiles to destroy asteroids.
- **Asteroid Splitting:** When an asteroid is shot, it splits into smaller asteroids.
- **Collisions:** The game ends if the player collides with an asteroid.

## Future Improvements

- Implement scoring system.
- Add sound effects and background music.
